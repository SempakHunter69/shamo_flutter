# Shoe Store E-Commerce App - Flutter Case Study

A new Flutter project.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a documentation of my journey in building a fully functional E-Commerce app for a shoe store using Flutter, a versatile framework for crafting natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. The app demonstrates various aspects of modern app development, from user interface design to state management and integration with APIs.
